The monster starts on one end of the board and moves to the other 
side in a direct path. The monster starts off as far away from 
players as possible, in the event of a tie it rolls. If it senses 
a player it will attack the first player noticed, after that, it 
is based on most damage taken, currently engaged combat, or line 
of sight.
