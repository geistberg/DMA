Death Match Arena - Rule set for PVP tabletop combat

This is a set of rules that can be used by anyone to engage friends in a player versus player combat. It is platform agnostic; so you can use characters from Dungeons and Dragons, Pathfinder, MouseGuard, or any other game system. It can support as many players are you can fit at the table. You can also break up the combat rounds into brackets to determine bragging rights.
